## Introduction

[Power BI](https://www.tableau.com/) as Tableau is a data visualization tool which provides pictorial and graphical representations of data.

Your aim in this lab is to create a **Power BI dashboard** that shows the insights you find useful from de given data.

## Your `data`
In the `data` folder you will find the following files:

**1. classicmodels.sql** : the classicmodels database (you can import it directly if you are using tableau desktop)

**2. ERD.png** : the ERD of the classicmodels database

**3. .xlsx file** : This excel file contains the data displayed in several sheets inside the file. You'll have to build the relationships between tables on your own.

## Getting Started


#### Challenge 1
Open Tableau in your laptop and import the data.

Create at least **`5 sheets`** explaining different insights, pay attention to the details, choose the proper figures and/or tables, build the sheets coherently with each other (example: if china is red in a graph it shoul be associated to red everywhere).

#### Challenge 2 
Create at least **`two dashboards`** where you structure the info in the sheets in a way that everything make sense, it's easily readable and self explanatory.

#### Challenge 3
Create a **`story`** to connect everything together. It should include connecting buttons.

## Deliverables

Create your own [tableau public profile](https://public.tableau.com/s/), and upload your dashboard. Remember to set it public so anyone can check it out.

+ `Markdown` file explaining the most important insights you found in the data.
+ `Link` to your tableau public profile dashboard (You can include it in the markdown file).
